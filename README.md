# Simple Bruteforcer
This is a password Bruteforcer that attempts to use almost every existing character (from your keyboard) to crack a password. How this works is that once you click the key **F3**, the bruteforcer starts to work and attempts to bruteforce the password of any account from any site/app, however for the bruteforcer to detect it's target, you must focus your mouse (or basically click on) on the Password Textbox in the log-in page.

The bruteforcer will attempt to paste the password that it predicts and click "Enter," however some sites do not log in from just clicking the **Enter key**, which may be a problem. Also, it may be a problem if the site has limited login attempts (which most sites/apps use), so this bruteforcer is for very basic apps/sites.

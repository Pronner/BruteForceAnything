# Simple Bruteforcer
This is a password Bruteforcer that attempts to use almost every existing character (from your keyboard) to crack a password. How this works is that once you click the key **F3**, the bruteforcer starts to work and attempts to bruteforce the password of any account from any site, however for the bruteforcer to detect it's target, you must focus your mouse on the Password Textbox in the log-in page.

The bruteforcer will attempt to paste the password that it predicts and clicks "Enter," however if the site does not support the Enter key to log in, that may be a problem. Also, it may be a problem if the site has limited login attempts (which most sites/apps use), so this bruteforcer is for very basic apps/sites.
